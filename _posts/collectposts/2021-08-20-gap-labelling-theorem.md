&ensp;Suppose that there is a gap on some Hamiltonian. Naturally, this gap separates the states with their eigenenergies below and above the gap, and thus we can correlate the gap by the projection operator $p$:

$$
p=p^*=p^2.
$$

There is an equivalence relation between two projections in a $C^*$-algebra $A$.

> **Definition.** Let $p,q$ be projection operators. Then we  say $p$ and $q$ are **Murray-von Neumann equivalent**, writing $p\sim q$, if there is $u\in A$ such that $p=u^* u$ and $q=uu^*$.
